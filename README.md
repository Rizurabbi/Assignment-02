What’s this about?
This project analyzes a dataset of credit card transactions to spot differences between fraudulent and normal transactions. The goal? Find hidden patterns that could help detect fraud faster!

Key Takeaways
✔ Fraud is rare but costly: Only 0.17% of transactions were fraud (492 out of 284,807).
✔ Small transactions = higher risk: 75% of frauds were under $50, but a few big ones caused major damage.
✔ Time matters: Fraud happens anytime, while normal transactions follow daily routines (like lunchtime spikes).
✔ Sneaky behavior: Fraudsters often make small test charges before larger ones.
